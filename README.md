# Dungeon Hero
This is a simple Dungeon Crawler game built with Jcanvas. It's a really cool Jquery plugin that makes HTML5 canvas easy to work with.
It was really fun to make and I plan to continue developing it into a full game. Object oriented programming at its best!

## Running Locally

Just clone this repository, and you are good to go. This just uses HTML5's canvas, along with Jquery, and Jcanvas.`


## Making your customization

* Go to line 641, where you see timer. This will be the delay between monster attacks. The higher the number, the longer it takes in between.

* At the top of the code you can change the starting hero's stats and name.


## Issues

This game was built in a week for class at my bootcamp. So it has some ole problems. The goal is to continue working on it.

*Sometimes the map tries to re-render itself during combat, but its more of a cosmetic issue than funtionality

*Set timeout is used alot to delay actions, this sometimes causes bugs during combat and you have to reset to fix it.

*Don't reload your browser because there is no save fucntion at the current moment.

*Occasional bugs during battle if you try to pick actions too soon one after the other, so play patiently at the moment.

## Inspiration

*The Stick man Rpg from the old scientific calculators in like 2002
*Diablo
*Dungeon Master
